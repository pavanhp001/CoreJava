We are required to have telephone customers complete order verification by an independent third party before we can install your service. It will take about 3 minutes to complete once I transfer you. 

This verification process will be done by an automated system that will require you to respond with a clear "Yes" or "No". 
If after you provide your name and address, you have questions, you may say help or operator and you will be transferred to a representative to complete the verification. If the system does not recognize a response you may also be routed to a live agent.  
- The third party will confirm the phone number and address where your service is to be activated.  
- They will confirm Cox as your local service provider 
- They will confirm Cox as your local and long distance service provider.  
- They will ask about Enhanced 911.  

Cox&#39;s phone service uses a telephone modem and/or other Cox equipment connected to your home&#39;s power. As reminders, during a power outage, you will not have access to phone service or 911 unless each piece of Cox equipment has a battery installed. If you have not already done so, you can purchase batteries from Cox later and more information about that will be in your welcome kit. You are responsible for monitoring the battery and ordering a replacement.  It&#39;s very important that you contact Cox before the telephone equipment is moved, either within your home or to another residence, so that emergency responders can locate you when you call 911.   Do you have any questions about this? Ok&#33; May I please place you on hold while I connect you with the Third Party verification company?
